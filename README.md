# BookieNook
Full Stack Project

[BookieNook](https://ashlenprice.github.io/bookienook/) is a web app for children to share and inspire eachother with the books they read. They can go on the app and see books that are listed with corressponing reviews. They can add/edit and delete reviews that they have written.


## Process
With this project I was very methodical in the process. I planned a lot. I spent my first day to day and half planning my app and de-scoped it several times. I made better use of the issue queue. It was still a challenge to finish all the things I wanted to do for my app within the time allotted. I feel like writting the back end took me a while but so did the front end.

## Technologies used
- JS
- handlebars
- HTML/CSS
- Lucid Chart
- Evernote
- Ruby (backend)
- Ruby on Rails (backend)


## Unsolved problems
- A user has to know the review id to edit and delete reviews
- A user has to type in the book ID to create a review
- handlebars tables aren't formatted
- Style and format of the app still needs work.

## Future Fixes
- I would like to add functionality that allows the child to make a favorites list.
- Allows a teacher to monitor what kids in her class are reading
- I would like to clean up the UI of the app.
- I would like for a kid to add to the book list by adding their own books.
